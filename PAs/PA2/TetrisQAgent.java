        One thing we can do is get the grayscale image
        where squares in the image are 0.0 if unoccupied, 0.5 if
        there is a "background" square (i.e. that square is occupied
        but it is not the current piece being placed), and 1.0 for
        any squares that the current piece is being considered for.
        
        We can then flatten this image to get a row-vector, but we
        can do more than this! Try to be creative: how can you measure the
        "state" of the game without relying on the pixels? If you were given
        a tetris game midway through play, what properties would you look for?
